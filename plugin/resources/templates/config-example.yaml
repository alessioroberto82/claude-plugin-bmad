# All fields are optional. Only include what you need to override.

# Test-Driven Development (TDD) enforcement
# TDD is enabled by default. bmad-impl uses red-green-refactor cycle via bmad-tdd
# for each implementation unit. bmad-qa verifies TDD compliance by inspecting commit
# history for test(red): → feat(green): → refactor: pattern.
# When the workflow doesn't involve testable code, bmad-impl prompts to disable.

# Role overrides — add extra context or instructions per role
